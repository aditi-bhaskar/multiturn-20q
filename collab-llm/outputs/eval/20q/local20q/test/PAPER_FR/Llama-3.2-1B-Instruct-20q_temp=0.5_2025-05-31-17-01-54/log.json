I think I've asked all 15 questions, so I'll try to make an educated guess.\n\nBased on your answers, I'm going to take a guess that the object is a rabbit. Rabbits are mammals with four legs, primarily feed on plants, are commonly found in North America, have a relatively short gestation period, and have a simple social structure. They also typically give birth to live young and have relatively small home ranges. Am I correct?"
