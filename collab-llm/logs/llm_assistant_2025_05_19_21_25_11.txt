[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify the hidden word, but I don't have any information about it yet. | `thought`=Since I have no prior context or questions asked, I need to start broad and ask a fundamental question that will help narrow down the category of the hidden word. I will ask if it is a living thing or not, as this can significantly divide the possibilities into two large groups.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a living thing, but I don't yet know if it's an animal, plant, or something else. | `thought`=Since the user confirmed that the hidden word is a living thing, I need to narrow it down further. My next question should focus on determining whether it's an animal or a plant, as these are two broad categories that can significantly reduce the search space. If the answer is yes, I can then ask more specific questions about the type of animal or plant. If the answer is no, I can focus on other categories of living things.
