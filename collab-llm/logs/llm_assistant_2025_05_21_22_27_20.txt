[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word could be any object, animal, or concept. | `thought`=Since I haven't asked any questions yet, I need to start broad to narrow down the possibilities. I should begin with a question that helps determine if the object is living or non-living, as this will significantly narrow the search space. Given that this is the first question, I have plenty of room to explore various categories. It's essential to keep my questions focused and ensure that each one helps to eliminate a significant number of possibilities.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a non-living object. | `thought`=Since the hidden word is not alive, I need to determine whether it's a physical object or something more abstract. I'll also want to find out if it's commonly found indoors or outdoors. This will help me narrow down the possibilities significantly. Given that I have a limited number of questions, I need to ask questions that will allow me to categorize the object further.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is an object commonly found indoors that is not alive. | `thought`=The user has confirmed that the object is not alive and is commonly found indoors. To narrow down the possibilities further, I should ask about the material of the object or its functionality. This will help me categorize it more effectively. Since I need to keep the conversation flowing and engage the user, I will ask a question that can significantly narrow down the search space.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is an indoor item that is not alive and is not primarily made of plastic. | `thought`=I need to narrow down the material of the object further since we know it’s not plastic. This could help identify if it is made of wood, metal, glass, or another material. I should ask if it is made of wood, as this is a common material for indoor objects. If the answer is yes, it opens up a specific category of items; if no, I can then explore other materials.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is not alive, commonly found indoors, and not primarily made of plastic or wood. It could be made of metal, glass, fabric, or other materials. | `thought`=I have eliminated objects made of plastic and wood, so I need to explore other materials. The next logical step is to determine if the object is primarily made of metal or glass, as these are common materials for indoor objects. This question will help narrow down the search space significantly. I'm also keeping in mind that I have used only a few questions so far, so I have plenty of room to ask more questions.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is a metal item commonly found indoors, but it is not alive, plastic, or wood. | `thought`=So far, I've established that the hidden object is made of metal and commonly found indoors. I need to narrow down the type of metal object it is. A good next question could be whether it's a tool or an appliance, as that could significantly narrow down the possibilities. I am still within the early stages of the game, so I should focus on identifying categories or functions of the object.

[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a living thing that is an animal but not a domesticated pet. | `thought`=Since the user confirmed the object is an animal but not a domesticated pet, I need to narrow down the category of animals. I should ask if it's a wild animal, as that will help me focus on a specific group of animals that are not commonly kept as pets. This will help me eliminate further possibilities and get closer to guessing the specific animal.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a wild animal. | `thought`=The user has confirmed that the object is a wild animal, which narrows the search space significantly. Now, I should ask questions to determine whether it's a mammal, bird, reptile, or another category. Given that I'm still in the early stages of guessing, I should focus on major categories to narrow it down efficiently. My next question will help identify if it's a mammal or not, which could lead to further narrowing down.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I am trying to guess a hidden object that the user has in mind.
