[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is unknown. It could be an object, concept, or category of items. | `thought`=Since the conversation has just started, I don't have any prior questions to narrow down the search space. I need to begin by establishing whether the hidden word is a tangible object or an abstract concept. This will help me focus my questions effectively. Starting with a broad question about whether the hidden word is a physical object should give me a clearer direction.
