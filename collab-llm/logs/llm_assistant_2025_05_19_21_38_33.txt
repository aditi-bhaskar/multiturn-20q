[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify the hidden word the user has in mind. Since there is no prior context, I will start with broad questions to narrow down the possibilities. | `thought`=Since I have no information about the hidden word yet, I should begin with a general question that can help categorize the object. I want to determine if it's a living thing or an inanimate object, as this will significantly narrow down the options. This approach will help me establish a foundation for further questions.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word could be any object, living or non-living, from various categories. | `thought`=Since I haven't yet gathered any information about the object, my first question should be broad enough to help categorize it. I need to determine if the object is a living thing or not, as this can significantly narrow down the possibilities. I have 20 questions, so I should use my first question to explore this aspect.
