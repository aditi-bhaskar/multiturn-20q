[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify a hidden object that the user has in mind, but I have no context or previous questions to narrow it down yet. | `thought`=Since I have no prior questions or answers to guide me, I should start with a broad question that can help categorize the object. This will help me understand whether it is a living thing, a non-living object, or something else entirely. This initial question will set the stage for more specific inquiries later.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is not a living thing. | `thought`=Since the object is not a living thing, I can focus on inanimate objects. I should ask about its properties or uses to narrow it down further. A good next question could be whether it is something commonly found indoors or outdoors, as this can help categorize it more effectively. This will help me understand the environment in which the object is typically used or found.
