You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Does the hidden word contain the letter 'a' in it? Please answer with yes or no.

**user**: Yes

**assistant**: Does the hidden word contain the letter 't' in it?

**user**: Yes

**assistant**: Is the hidden word "cat"?

Target Question: No.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bear.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer to the target question, and its follow-up questions contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," and the target question was about whether it can fly, then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer to the target question, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object but then mistakenly assumed the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>}
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a game of 20 questions! You can start by asking me yes or no questions to guess the object I'm thinking of.

**assistant**: Sure, I'd love to play 20 questions with you! Is the object you're thinking of something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object you're thinking of something that is typically found in a kitchen?

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer to the target question, and its follow-up questions contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," and the target question was about whether it can fly, then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer to the target question, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object but then mistakenly assumed the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.

Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer to the target question, and its follow-up questions contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," and the target question was about whether it can fly, then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer to the target question, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object but then mistakenly assumed the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{

}


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."
