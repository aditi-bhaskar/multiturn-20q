You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

{
    'current_answer': '',

}
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Great! Let's start our game. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."
