[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify a hidden word that the user has in mind. The search space is currently wide, as I have not yet asked any questions. | `thought`=Since I haven't started asking questions yet, I need to begin narrowing down the possibilities. I should start with a broad question that can help categorize the hidden word into a specific type or category. This will help me understand if the word is a noun, verb, or something else. I should also consider if the word is tangible or intangible, as that can significantly influence the direction of my subsequent questions.
