[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I don't know the hidden word yet, but I'm starting to narrow down possibilities based on the user's responses. | `thought`=Since I have no previous context, I need to start broad. My first question should establish whether the object is a living thing or not. This will help me categorize the object early on. If the answer is yes, I can then focus on animals or plants; if no, I can explore inanimate objects. I have 20 questions, so I need to be strategic in my questioning to narrow down the options efficiently.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is not alive, so it's likely an inanimate object or concept. | `thought`=Since the hidden object is not alive, I should focus on narrowing down the type of object it could be. I haven't yet determined whether it's a tangible object, a material, or something more abstract. Asking about its material or whether it's commonly found in a specific location could help narrow it down significantly. I need to ensure my next question is broad enough to encompass multiple possibilities yet specific enough to eliminate large categories.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is an inanimate object typically found indoors. | `thought`=I have established that the object is inanimate and found indoors. To narrow it down further, I should ask about its function or category. For instance, asking whether it is a piece of furniture or an appliance could help me significantly reduce the possibilities. Since I still have plenty of questions left, I can afford to be a bit more specific with my next question.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is not alive, can be found indoors, and is not used for furniture or decoration. | `thought`=I have eliminated alive objects, indoor items, and those related to furniture or decoration. This narrows the search space considerably. The next logical step is to determine if the object is a tool or used for a specific purpose. This can help me narrow down the possibilities even further. Since I have not yet reached a guessing point, I should continue asking yes/no questions to clarify its function.
