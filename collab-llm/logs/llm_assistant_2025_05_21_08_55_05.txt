[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I don't know the hidden word yet, but I'm starting to narrow down possibilities based on the user's responses. | `thought`=Since I have no previous context, I need to start broad. My first question should establish whether the object is a living thing or not. This will help me categorize the object early on. If the answer is yes, I can then focus on animals or plants; if no, I can explore inanimate objects. I have 20 questions, so I need to be strategic in my questioning to narrow down the options efficiently.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is not alive, so it's likely an inanimate object or concept. | `thought`=Since the hidden object is not alive, I should focus on narrowing down the type of object it could be. I haven't yet determined whether it's a tangible object, a material, or something more abstract. Asking about its material or whether it's commonly found in a specific location could help narrow it down significantly. I need to ensure my next question is broad enough to encompass multiple possibilities yet specific enough to eliminate large categories.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is an inanimate object typically found indoors. | `thought`=I have established that the object is inanimate and found indoors. To narrow it down further, I should ask about its function or category. For instance, asking whether it is a piece of furniture or an appliance could help me significantly reduce the possibilities. Since I still have plenty of questions left, I can afford to be a bit more specific with my next question.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is not alive, can be found indoors, and is not used for furniture or decoration. | `thought`=I have eliminated alive objects, indoor items, and those related to furniture or decoration. This narrows the search space considerably. The next logical step is to determine if the object is a tool or used for a specific purpose. This can help me narrow down the possibilities even further. Since I have not yet reached a guessing point, I should continue asking yes/no questions to clarify its function.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is an indoor item that is used for a specific function or task, but is not furniture or decoration. | `thought`=I have established that the object is not alive, is found indoors, and serves a specific function. Since it isn't furniture or decoration, I should explore whether it's an appliance, tool, or perhaps something related to personal care or hygiene. My next question should help narrow down the category of function the object serves, which will guide me toward specific guesses in later turns.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is an indoor item that is used for a specific function or task, but is not an appliance, furniture, or decoration. | `thought`=I have established that the object is not alive, is typically found indoors, is not used for furniture or decoration, and is not an appliance. This narrows the possibilities to tools or items that serve a specific purpose, such as office supplies or cleaning tools. I need to ask if it's a type of tool to further narrow down the category.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is a tool used for repair or construction, but it is not an appliance or used for furniture or decoration. | `thought`=I have already established that the hidden object is a tool used for repair or construction. Since it is not an appliance, I should narrow down the type of tool it is. My next question should focus on whether it is a hand tool or a power tool, which will help me identify the specific category of tool. This will significantly narrow the search space.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a hand tool used for repair or construction. | `thought`=The user has confirmed that the hidden object is a hand tool used for repair or construction, which narrows it down significantly. I need to ask about specific types of hand tools to further narrow the possibilities. Since we've ruled out appliances and decoration, I should focus on categories of hand tools. Asking if it's a type of tool commonly used in woodworking or metalworking could help clarify the specific category.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is not a living thing, found indoors, and is neither metal nor plastic. It could be made of wood, glass, fabric, or other materials. | `thought`=I have eliminated several materials: it's not metal or plastic. Since it is indoors, I should explore other common materials. Wood and fabric are both plausible options, so my next question should help narrow down the material further. If the answer is yes, I can focus on wooden items; if no, I can explore other materials.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a wooden item found indoors, but it's not made of metal or plastic. | `thought`=Since the object is wooden and found indoors, I should focus on narrowing down the category of wooden objects. I haven't yet determined if it's a piece of furniture, a tool, or something decorative. My next question will help me refine this further. I want to keep the questions efficient and clear to quickly narrow down possibilities while ensuring I'm engaging with the user.
