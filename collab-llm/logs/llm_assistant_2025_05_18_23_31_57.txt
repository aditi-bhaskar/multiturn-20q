[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information about the hidden word yet, so the search space is broad and undefined. | `thought`=Since this is the beginning of the game, I need to start with a general question that can help me narrow down the category of the hidden word. Asking if it's a living thing or an inanimate object could significantly reduce the possibilities. I will also ensure to keep the tone engaging and friendly to encourage the user to respond.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object is a living thing, potentially a plant or an animal. | `thought`=Since the user confirmed that the hidden word is something alive, I should narrow down whether it's a plant or an animal. This will help me categorize the possibilities more effectively. Asking if it is an animal will significantly reduce the search space, allowing me to focus on either group in subsequent questions. I'm still early in the game, so I have plenty of questions left to refine my guesses.
