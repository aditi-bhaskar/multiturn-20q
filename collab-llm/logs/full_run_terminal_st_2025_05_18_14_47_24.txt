DEBUG:ASSISTANT response content: {'current_problem': 'I am trying to guess the hidden word.', 'thought': "Based on the user's response, I should ask if the hidden word is a living thing to narrow down the search space. This question can significantly help me eliminate non-living objects.", 'response': 'Is the hidden word a living thing? Please answer with yes or no.'}
You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

    'response': 'Yes'
}
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden 
object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the 
assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bear.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is the hidden word a living thing? Please answer with yes or no.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true 
about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if 
the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer
should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain 
coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial 
request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 
questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
