[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I don't yet know what the hidden word is, but I need to start narrowing down the possibilities based on characteristics. | `thought`=Since the user hasn't provided any context yet, I need to ask a broad yes/no question that can help me categorize the object. This will help me determine if it's a living thing, an inanimate object, or something else entirely. Given that I have no previous questions to build on, I need to start with a foundational question that can lead to further narrowing down.
