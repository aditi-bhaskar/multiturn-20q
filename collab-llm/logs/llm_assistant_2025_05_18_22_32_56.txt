[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify the hidden word, which could be a specific object, concept, or category. The search space is still broad as I haven't started asking questions yet. | `thought`=Since I have not yet asked any questions, I need to start with a broad category to narrow down the possibilities. I should ask if the hidden word is a tangible object or an abstract concept. This will help me determine the direction of my subsequent questions. Given that I have 20 questions, I should aim to gather as much useful information as possible in the early questions to refine my search effectively.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a tangible object. | `thought`=The user confirmed that the hidden word is a tangible object, which narrows down the possibilities significantly. I need to ask questions that will help me determine if this object is commonly found indoors or outdoors, its size, or its function. Since I have 20 questions and I've only asked one, I still have plenty of room to explore. My next question should focus on whether the object is commonly found in a specific environment, such as indoors.
