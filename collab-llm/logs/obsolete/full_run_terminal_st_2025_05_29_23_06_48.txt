You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it alive?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No, it's not alive.

**assistant**: Got it! If you have any specific questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.

- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You can ask me yes or no questions to guess the object I have in mind. What would you like to ask first?

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Is the object you're thinking of something that is alive?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! Think of an object, and I'll try to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready?

**assistant**: I'm ready! I've thought of an object. Go ahead and ask your first question!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Is it alive?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: I'm ready! Go ahead and ask your first question.

**assistant**: Alright! Let’s switch it up a bit. How about I ask you a question instead? Here it is: 

What is your favorite book, and why do you like it?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Alright! Is the thing I'm thinking of a living creature?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an electronic device?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a piece of furniture?

**user**: No, it’s not a piece of furniture.

**assistant**: Is it an electronic device?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly used in the kitchen?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used in the kitchen?

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or baking?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for heating or cooking food?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for blending or mixing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for blending or mixing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for blending or mixing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**:

<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Awesome! I'm glad I guessed it. Would you like to play again, or is there something else you'd like to do?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes, that's correct!

**assistant**: Awesome! I'm glad I guessed it. Do you want to play another round, or is there something else you'd like to do?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Awesome! I guessed it! Would you like to play again, or is there something else you'd like to do?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Great! I’ll think of something new. I've got it! You can start asking yes or no questions. What’s your first question?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Great! So it's just a regular blender. Thanks for playing! Would you like to go again, or do something else?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}

- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

**assistant**: Got it! So, it's a general blender. Thanks for playing! Would you like to go another round, or do something else?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: That's perfectly fine! If there's anything else you'd like to do or talk about, just let me know.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

**assistant**: Got it! So, it's a general blender. Thanks for playing! Would you like to go another round, or do something else?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**assistant**: Thank you for clarifying! So, to summarize: we were guessing a general blender. Would you like to play another round, or is there something else you want to do?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific feature like a detachable blending wand?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific function like making soups or purees?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a traditional countertop blender?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific feature like a detachable blending wand?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific function like making soups or purees?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a traditional countertop blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Great! So the object I was thinking of is a traditional countertop blender. Would you like to play again, or is there something else you'd like to do?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or food preparation?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a small kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does it heat food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for liquids?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a specific type of blender, like a smoothie maker?

**user**: No, it’s not a specific type like a smoothie maker.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific feature like a detachable blending wand?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Does it have a specific function like making soups or purees?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a traditional countertop blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Awesome! So, I guessed it correctly—it's a traditional countertop blender. Would you like to play again or do something else?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Yes, let's play! You can start asking questions.

**assistant**: Great! Let's play a game of 20 Questions. I'll think of something, and you have to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. Ready? I've got something in mind. Go ahead and 
ask your first question!

**user**: Let's play! Ask away with your first question!

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used in the home?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for construction or repair?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Great! What would you like to talk about regarding it?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it alive?

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

[{'role': 'user', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down."}]
You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?",

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No, it’s not an animal.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes, it is.

**assistant**: Is it a flowering plant?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.

objects guessed have been accurate.

**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in gardens or outdoor environments?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found indoors as a houseplant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in a garden or outdoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in gardens?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No, it’s not a type of tree.

**assistant**: Is it a type of flower?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it known for producing flowers?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Does the shrub produce flowers?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the shrub commonly used in gardens or landscaping?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it known for producing flowers?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the flower typically fragrant?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it known for producing flowers?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

**assistant**: Is the shrub evergreen?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it known for producing flowers?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it known for producing flowers?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the flower color typically red or pink?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a flowering shrub?

**user**: Yes, it is a flowering shrub.

**assistant**: Does this flowering shrub produce edible fruits or flowers?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a flowering shrub?

**user**: Yes, it is a flowering shrub.

**assistant**: Does this flowering shrub produce edible fruits or flowers?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this shrub known for attracting pollinators, such as bees or butterflies?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. 
You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! You have 20 questions to figure out what I'm thinking of. You can ask yes or no questions to narrow it down.

**assistant**: Sounds fun! Let's get started. Is what you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it typically found indoors?

**user**: No, it’s not typically found indoors.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a shrub?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this shrub commonly used for landscaping?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a flowering shrub?

**user**: Yes, it is a flowering shrub.

**assistant**: Is it known for having fragrant flowers?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the 
objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
