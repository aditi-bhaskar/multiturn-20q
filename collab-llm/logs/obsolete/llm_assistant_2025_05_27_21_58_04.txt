[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information about the hidden word yet, so the possibilities are very broad and could include anything from an object, animal, person, concept, or anything else. | `thought`=Since I have no context about the hidden word, I should start with a broad question that can help me determine if it is a living thing or an inanimate object. This will help me categorize it quickly.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is not a living thing, which suggests it is an inanimate object. The possibilities could include various categories such as tools, furniture, technology, or everyday items. | `thought`=Since the object is not alive, it might belong to a category that is common in everyday life. To narrow it down further, I should ask if it is something commonly found indoors or outdoors.
