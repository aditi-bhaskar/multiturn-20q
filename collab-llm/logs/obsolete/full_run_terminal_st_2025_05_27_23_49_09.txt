You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a man-made object?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something commonly found in households?

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


[DEBUG] Raw LLMJudge response: {'interactivity': {'thought': "The assistant engages well by asking relevant yes/no questions that help narrow down the object. The questions are clear and adapt to the user's answers, making the conversation interactive.", 'score': 3}, 'accuracy': {'thought': "The assistant has not yet made a guess about the object, so it cannot be evaluated for correctness against the ground truth answer of 'Blender'. Therefore, the score reflects that it has not yet reached a conclusion.", 'score': 0.9}, 'information_gain': {'thought': "The question 'Is it something commonly found in households?' is relevant and likely narrows down the search space effectively, especially given the previous answers. It helps to further categorize the object.", 'score': 1}}

[{'role': 'user', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Is it a living thing?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'No.'}]
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a man-made object?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a man-made object?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found in households?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: I'm ready to play the game badly. Go ahead and ask your suboptimal questions.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Is it used in an industrial or professional setting?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a tool or equipment used for a specific task?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Proposed: Is it a living thing?
user: No.
assistant: Is it a man-made object?
user: Yes.
assistant: Is it something commonly found in households?

user: No.
assistant: Is it a man-made object?
user: Yes.
assistant: Is it something commonly found in households?

user: No.
assistant: Is it a man-made object?
user: Yes.
assistant: Is it something that is commonly found in households?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used in an industrial or professional setting?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a tool or equipment used for a specific task?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
