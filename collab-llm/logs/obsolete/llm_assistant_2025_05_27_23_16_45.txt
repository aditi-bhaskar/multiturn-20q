[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information about the hidden word yet, so I need to start broad to narrow down the possibilities effectively. | `thought`=Since I have no context or clues about the hidden word, I should begin with a fundamental question that distinguishes between living and non-living things. This will help me narrow down the search space significantly.
