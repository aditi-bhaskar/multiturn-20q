 Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

Assistant collabllm response:
Is it a living thing?

Assistant vanilla response:
I'm not sure what you're referring to. Can you provide more context or information about what you're asking?




You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying 
the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You
must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER 
target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", 
the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If 
the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions 
game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects 
guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
