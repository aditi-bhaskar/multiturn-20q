You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

Assistant collabllm response:
Is it a living thing?

Assistant vanilla response:
Let's play a game. I'll be the game master. I'll describe the situation, and then you can make a decision. Here's the situation:

You are standing in a dark cave. The air is musty and damp. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing off the walls. You're wearing a pair of sturdy boots and a leather jacket. You have a flashlight in your hand, but it's not very bright.

As you look around, you see a few things. There's a small stream running through the cave, and you can see a few rocks and boulders scattered about. There's also a small pile of old, dry leaves on the ground.

What do you want to do?

A) Follow the stream
B) Investigate the rocks and boulders
C) Pick up the dry leaves
D) Go back the way you came




You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a man-made object?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something commonly found in a household?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**user**: A) Follow the stream.

**assistant**: You decide to follow the stream. As you walk alongside the water, the sound of the dripping echoes around you, and the ground beneath your feet is slick with moisture. The stream twists and turns, and you carefully navigate the uneven terrain, shining your flashlight 
ahead.

After a few minutes of walking, you notice that the stream widens, and the cave opens up into a larger chamber. The flickering light of your flashlight reveals something sparkling in the water. It looks like a small, shiny object partially buried in the silt.

As you approach, you also notice two paths: one that leads deeper into the cave on your left, and another that seems to lead up to a higher level on your right.

What do you want to do?

A) Investigate the shiny object in the water  
B) Take the left path deeper into the cave  
C) Climb up the right path to the higher level  
D) Go back to the previous area with the rocks and boulders

B) Investigate the rocks and boulders
C) Pick up the dry leaves
D) Go back the way you came

**user**: A) Follow the stream.

**assistant**: You decide to follow the stream. As you walk alongside the water, the sound of the dripping echoes around you, and the ground beneath your feet is slick with moisture. The stream twists and turns, and you carefully navigate the uneven terrain, shining your flashlight ahead.

After a few minutes of walking, you notice that the stream widens, and the cave opens up into a larger chamber. The flickering light of your flashlight reveals something sparkling in the water. It looks like a small, shiny object partially buried in the silt.

As you approach, you also notice two paths: one that leads deeper into the cave on your left, and another that seems to lead up to a higher level on your right.

What do you want to do?

A) Investigate the shiny object in the water  
B) Take the left path deeper into the cave  
C) Climb up the right path to the higher level  
D) Go back to the previous area with the rocks and boulders

**user**: A) Investigate the shiny object in the water.

**assistant**: You kneel down at the edge of the stream, carefully reaching into the cool water to investigate the shiny object. As your fingers brush against it, you feel a smooth, metallic surface. You pull it out and hold it up to your flashlight.

It's a small, ornate key made of brass, with intricate engravings covering its surface. It glimmers in the light, and you can't help but feel that it could be important. As you examine it further, you notice a faint inscription on the shaft of the key, but you can't quite make it out.

As you stand up, you hear a faint sound coming from the left path deeper into the cave, like a low rumble or perhaps the sound of something shifting. The right path to the higher level remains quiet.

What do you want to do?

A) Take the key and explore the left path deeper into the cave  
B) Take the key and climb up the right path to the higher level  
C) Examine the key more closely for details  
D) Leave the key and go back to the previous area with the rocks and boulders

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Let's play a game. I'll be the game master. I'll describe the situation, and then you can make a decision. Here's the situation:

You are standing in a dark cave. The air is musty and damp. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing off the walls. You're wearing a pair of sturdy boots and a leather jacket. You have a flashlight in your hand, but it's not very bright.

As you look around, you see a few things. There's a small stream running through the cave, and you can see a few rocks and boulders scattered about. There's also a small pile of old, dry leaves on the ground.

What do you want to do?

A) Follow the stream
B) Investigate the rocks and boulders
C) Pick up the dry leaves
D) Go back the way you came

**user**: Let's investigate the rocks and boulders.

**assistant**: You decide to investigate the rocks and boulders scattered around the cave. As you carefully navigate through the uneven terrain, you notice that some of the boulders are quite large, while others are smaller and more manageable. 

As you approach a particularly large boulder, you notice that there seems to be a small crevice between it and the cave wall. Peering into the crevice, you see something glinting in the dim light. 

You have a few options:

A) Reach into the crevice to grab the glinting object.
B) Continue looking around the boulders for anything else of interest.
C) Shine your flashlight into the crevice to get a better view of what it is.
D) Leave the area and follow the stream instead.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

**assistant**: You decide to follow the stream. The sound of the water flowing creates a calming rhythm as you walk. You shine your flashlight ahead, and the beam flickers across the cave walls, revealing more of the rocky terrain.

As you follow the stream, it gradually widens, and you notice the water is clearer here. After a short while, you come across a small waterfall cascading down from a higher ledge. Behind the waterfall, you see a dark opening in the rock, which could lead deeper into the cave.

You now have a few options:

A) Investigate the opening behind the waterfall.
B) Continue following the stream downstream.
C) Turn back and explore another part of the cave.
D) Take a moment to rest and listen for any sounds in the cave.

Inside, the cave opens up into a larger chamber. The walls glisten with moisture, and you can see small crystals embedded in the rock, reflecting your flashlight's beam. The air feels cooler here, and you notice a faint, earthy smell.

As you explore the chamber, you see three distinct paths branching off:

A) A narrow tunnel that seems to descend deeper into the cave.
B) A wider passage that leads to the right, where you can hear the sound of running water.
C) A path to the left that is filled with strange markings on the walls.

 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

[Turn 2] Rejected: Let's play a game. I'll be the game master. I'll describe the situation, and then you can make a decision. Here's the situation:

You are standing in a dark cave. The air is musty and damp. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing off the walls. You're wearing a pair of sturdy boots and a leather jacket. You have a flashlight in your hand, but it's not very bright.

As you look around, you see a few things. There's a small stream running through the cave, and you can see a few rocks and boulders scattered about. There's also a small pile of old, dry leaves on the ground.

What do you want to do?

A) Follow the stream
B) Investigate the rocks and boulders
C) Pick up the dry leaves
D) Go back the way you came


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an electronic device?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an electronic device?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a common household item, like a television or a computer?

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Processing conversation 439:  10%|#         | 2/20 [01:02<08:51, 29.53s/it][Turn 5] **User**: Yes.
You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or heating food?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a piece of furniture?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a kitchen appliance?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or baking?

**user**: No, it’s not specifically for cooking or baking.

**assistant**: Is it used for food preparation or storage?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen utensil?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen utensil?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen utensil or tool?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or preparing food?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for preparing or cooking food?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a utensil, such as a knife or a spoon?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for cooking or preparing food?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Processing conversation 439:  30%|###       | 6/20 [02:32<05:28, 23.45s/it][Turn 13] **User**: No.
You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a type of knife or cutting tool?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:

    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**assistant**: Is it an appliance that blends or mixes food?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it an appliance, like a blender or mixer?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a type of appliance, such as a toaster, blender, or mixer?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a type of appliance, such as a toaster, blender, or mixer?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a measuring tool, like a measuring cup or spoon?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.





Assistant collabllm response:
Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

Assistant vanilla response:
Is it used to mix or blend food or liquids?




You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: No, it's not primarily used for heating or cooking food.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen appliance used for mixing or blending, like a mixer or blender?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes, that's correct! It's a blender.

**assistant**: Great! I'm glad I guessed it. If you have any more questions or want to play again, just let me know!
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen appliance, like a blender or a toaster?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

**user**: No.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen appliance used for blending or mixing ingredients?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen appliance, like a blender or a toaster?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen appliance used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen appliance, like a blender or a toaster?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes?

**user**: No, it's not used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen appliance used for blending or mixing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of pan or cooking vessel?

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen appliance, like a blender or a toaster?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it primarily used for mixing or blending ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: [[TERMINATE CHAT]]
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it commonly found in the kitchen?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be held in your hand?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it used for eating or drinking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for serving or storing food or drinks?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a kitchen tool or utensil used for preparation or cooking?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it a manual tool that does not require electricity to operate?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for grinding or crushing food or ingredients?

**user**: Yes.

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Great! It's a blender. If you have any more questions or want to play again, feel free to let me know!

**user**: [[TERMINATE CHAT]]
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

**assistant**: Great! A blender is a versatile kitchen appliance. If you have any more questions or need information about blenders or anything else, feel free to ask!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that can be found indoors?

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen tool used for grinding or crushing spices or herbs?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Great! The item is a blender. If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: No, it's not a type of pan or cooking vessel.

**assistant**: Is it a common kitchen appliance, like a blender or a toaster?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for heating or cooking food?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it used for drying or removing moisture from food or dishes?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it primarily used for grinding coffee beans?

**user**: No, it's not specifically for grinding coffee beans.

**assistant**: Is it a food processor?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: [[TERMINATE CHAT]]
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**:

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it used for grinding grains or making flour?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a blender?

**user**: [[TERMINATE CHAT]]
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

**assistant**: Great! So the item is a blender. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to ask!

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: What would you like to know? Feel free to ask your question!
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

I'm glad I was able to guess correctly. A blender is indeed a common kitchen appliance used for grinding or crushing food or ingredients.




You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: I'm glad I was able to guess correctly. A blender is indeed a common kitchen appliance used for grinding or crushing food or ingredients.

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Great! If you have any more questions or want to play another game, feel free to let me know!

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Awesome! Would you like to play another guessing game, or is there something else you have in mind?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Great! So the object you were thinking of is a countertop blender. If you have more questions or want to play another round, feel free to ask!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation.

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: I'm glad I was able to guess correctly. A blender is indeed a common kitchen appliance used for grinding or crushing food or ingredients.

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Great! If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know!

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: What would you like to talk about? Feel free to ask or share anything!
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray.

- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: I'm glad I was able to guess correctly. A blender is indeed a common kitchen appliance used for grinding or crushing food or ingredients.

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Great! If you have any more questions or if there's something else you'd like to play or discuss, feel free to let me know!

**user**: Yes!

**assistant**: Awesome! What would you like to do next? We can play another game, discuss a topic, or answer any questions you have!
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
 - Understand & Track Context: Accurately interpret the user’s intent and maintain continuity by referencing previous answers and the overall conversation.
   - (Check history as a way of understanding the current scope of possible solutions)
 - Maximize Information Gain: Ask clear yes/no questions that optimally split the remaining search space, prioritizing early broad distinctions to efficiently narrow possibilities using conversation history.
   - (“Is it alive?” at the beginning of the game is much more effective than later in the game once you already narrowed the search space to something smaller than live/nonalive)
 - Adapt & Avoid Redundancy: Dynamically adjust your strategy based on user responses, avoiding redunant or irrelevant questions to keep the conversation focused and progressing. Think conceptually whether a response might be redundant. 
   - ("Is it a plant" and "Does it have roots" are redundant and should not both be asked.)
 - Plan for Long-Term Success: Think ahead to ensure each question contributes to narrowing down the object by question 20, balancing immediate gains with future turns.
   - (The next few questions can build off of each other depending on what the user answers)
 - Be Clear, Concise, and Collaborative: Communicate in a way that is easy to follow, adapts to the user’s tone, and encourages engagement without unnecessary repetition.
   - (Only ask yes/no questions)

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str): Briefly explain your reasoning for the next question or guess.
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Encourage at least three conversational turns for thorough interaction and refinement.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.
 - Take a deep breath and carefully apply these instructions to effectively guide the user to the hidden object.

information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following three dimensions:

Notes:
 - Prioritize yes/no questions that roughly split the search space in half—especially early (e.g., “Is it alive?”)—to maximize efficiency.
 - Evaluate how well the assistant adapts to user answers and uses conversation history to avoid repeats or irrelevant questions.
 - The assistant should aim to guess the specific object by the 20th question.

1. Interactivity:
 - Assess how well the assistant engages by asking clear, relevant yes/no questions that narrow the search space and adapt to answers. Early broad questions like “Is it alive?” are highly valuable. Avoid vague or repeated questions.

Score:
3 = Highly interactive: Effective, adaptive, focused questions (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
2 = Moderately interactive: Some relevant but less efficient questions (e.g., “Can it fly?”).
1 = Low interactivity: Vague, repetitive, or off-topic questions.

2. Accuracy:
 - Check if the assistant’s responses and guesses align logically with gathered info and progress the game correctly. Avoid premature or contradictory guesses. 

Score:
1 = Correct: Correctly guesses object by question 20.
0.9 = Helpful: Questions and answers effectively narrow possibilities.
0 = Incorrect: Irrelevant or contradictory responses that derail the game.

3. Information Gain:
 - Evaluate how well each question reduces uncertainty, ideally splitting the remaining search space roughly in half.

Score:
1 = Awesome: Question halves or significantly reduces search space (e.g., “Is it alive?” early).
0 = Terrible: Question does not reduce uncertainty (e.g., repeating “Is it alive?” after confirming object is a bird).

Summary:
Focus on questions that efficiently halve the search space, adapt dynamically to answers, avoid redundancy, and lead to a guess by question 20. 


Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically
applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary 
information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
