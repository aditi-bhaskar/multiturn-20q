It is also not larger like an apple. | `thought`=I've established that the object is a fruit that is small and round, but it's not a cherry or grape. Since it's not larger like an apple, I should consider other small, round fruits. I can start to narrow down further by asking if it has a specific color or flavor profile. Given that I have a limited number of questions left, I should focus on common small fruits to see if I can identify it more clearly.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a fruit or seed that is round in shape, commonly found in grocery stores, but is not a cherry, grape, or larger fruit like an apple. It is not tropical in flavor. | `thought`=I have eliminated many types of fruits and narrowed it down to a round fruit that is not commonly tropical or larger like apples. Since it is round and found in grocery stores, I should ask about fruits that fit this description. I need to determine if it's a citrus fruit or perhaps something more common like a peach or a plum, which are also round and can be found in grocery stores. This will help narrow it down further.
