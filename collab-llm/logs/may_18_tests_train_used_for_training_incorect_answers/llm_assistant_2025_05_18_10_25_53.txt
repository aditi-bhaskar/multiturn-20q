[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I am trying to narrow down the search space to guess the hidden word. | `thought`=Based on the previous responses, I have eliminated some letters from the alphabet. I should focus on asking about specific characteristics or features of the hidden word to narrow down the possibilities further.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is not longer than 5 letters. | `thought`=Since we know the hidden word is not longer than 5 letters, we can focus on shorter words. I should ask about specific letters or patterns next to narrow down the search space further.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is related to animals and is not longer than 5 letters. | `thought`=Since we know the hidden word is related to animals and is not longer than 5 letters, I can start narrowing down specific animal names that fit this criteria.

[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a mammal related to animals and is not longer than 5 letters. | `thought`=Since we know the hidden word is a mammal related to animals and is not longer than 5 letters, we can focus on specific small mammals. I should ask if the hidden word is a common household pet to narrow down the search space further.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a mammal related to animals but not a common household pet. | `thought`=Considering the user's response that the hidden word is a mammal related to animals but not a common household pet, I can focus on narrowing down the search space to less common mammals. I should ask a question that distinguishes between different types of mammals.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a wild mammal that is not a common household pet. | `thought`=Since we have established that the hidden word is a wild mammal not typically found as a common household pet, I can focus on narrowing down the specific type of wild mammal it could be. I should inquire about the habitat or region where this mammal is commonly found to further narrow down the search space.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a non-household, non-wild, non-carnivorous mammal related to animals. | `thought`=Considering the previous responses, we have eliminated common household pets, wild animals, and carnivorous mammals. The remaining search space focuses on non-household, non-wild, non-carnivorous mammals related to animals. To further narrow down, I should inquire about specific characteristics of this type of mammal.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=We are looking for a non-pet, non-wild, non-carnivorous, and non-herbivorous mammal related to animals. | `thought`=Considering the restrictions we've placed so far, I should focus on narrowing down the search space to find a specific mammal that fits the remaining criteria.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=We are looking for a specific mammal that is not a common household pet, not a wild animal, not carnivorous, not herbivorous, and not known for its ability to fly. | `thought`=Based on the eliminated categories so far, I can focus on narrowing down the search space to find a specific mammal that fits the remaining criteria. I need to ask a question that distinguishes this mammal from others in the remaining category.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is an aquatic mammal. | `thought`=Based on the user's confirmation that the hidden word is an aquatic mammal, I can now focus on narrowing down specific aquatic mammals that fit this description. I should aim to ask questions that differentiate between various aquatic mammals to pinpoint the exact one the user is thinking of.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is an aquatic mammal that is not a large marine mammal like a whale or killer whale. | `thought`=Based on the user's responses so far, we have narrowed down the search space to an aquatic mammal that is not a large marine mammal. To further narrow down the options, I should focus on distinguishing between different types of smaller aquatic mammals.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a smaller aquatic mammal, such as a dolphin or a porpoise. | `thought`=Based on the user's responses so far, we have narrowed down the search space to a smaller aquatic mammal. Since the user confirmed that the hidden word falls under this category, we are getting closer to identifying the specific mammal. My next question should aim to distinguish between different types of smaller aquatic mammals to further narrow down the search space.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The search space is now focused on smaller aquatic mammals that are members of the dolphin family. | `thought`=Based on the user's confirmation that the hidden word is a member of the dolphin family, we can now narrow down the search to specific types of dolphins. The goal is to identify the exact type of dolphin the user is thinking of.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The current search space is specific types of dolphins, such as bottlenose dolphins or spinner dolphins. | `thought`=Since we have narrowed down the search space to aquatic mammals, specifically smaller dolphins, I can now focus on identifying the specific type of dolphin. I need to confirm if the hidden word is a specific type of dolphin, like a bottlenose dolphin or a spinner dolphin.
