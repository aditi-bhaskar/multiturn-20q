It might be helpful to ask if it's an accessory or a specific type of clothing not typically considered outerwear.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a type of clothing, but it is not outerwear, bottoms, or related to personal care, cleaning, or decoration. | `thought`=I have established that the object is a type of clothing, which is a positive step. Since it is not outerwear, bottoms, or related to personal care, I should focus on other categories of clothing. Given that I have eliminated many options, it might be helpful to ask if it's a type of top, such as a shirt or blouse. This will help further narrow down the possibilities.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a type of top, possibly a shirt or blouse. | `thought`=I have established that the object is a type of top, but I need to further narrow it down to a specific type of clothing. Since there are many variations of tops, I should ask whether it has specific characteristics, such as being formal or casual. This will help me focus on a smaller category of tops and get closer to guessing the exact item.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a casual top, specifically a t-shirt. | `thought`=I have narrowed down the search to a casual top, specifically a t-shirt. Since I know it's a t-shirt, I can start asking more specific questions about its characteristics. I can inquire about its color, design, or material to narrow it down further.

[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=A casual top, specifically a t-shirt, which can have various colors or patterns. | `thought`=The user has confirmed that the object is a casual top, specifically a t-shirt, and it can have various colors or patterns. I need to narrow down the specifics of the t-shirt. I can ask about the color or pattern to see if it leads me closer to guessing the specific t-shirt. Since I still have several questions left, I should focus on distinguishing between different types of t-shirts based on color or design.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is a casual t-shirt that can feature designs, logos, or text. | `thought`=I've narrowed down the object to a casual t-shirt, which can have various designs. Since I know it's a t-shirt, I can start asking about specific characteristics like the theme of the design or the intended audience. This could lead me to guess the specific t-shirt more quickly. I'm still within the limit of 20 questions, so I can ask a few more targeted questions before making a guess.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information yet about the hidden word, so the search space is very broad. | `thought`=Since I have no context or prior questions to narrow down the possibilities, I need to start with a general question that can help categorize the hidden word. I should ask if it's a living thing or an inanimate object, as this will significantly narrow down the options. Given that I'm at the very beginning of the game, it's essential to start broad and then refine from there. I also need to ensure my question is clear and easy for the user to answer.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a non-living object. | `thought`=Since the hidden word is not a living thing, I need to narrow down the possibilities by considering whether it's a tangible object or something more abstract.
