[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I don't yet know the category or specific characteristics of the hidden word. | `thought`=Since I have no context yet, I need to start broad to narrow down the possibilities. I should ask if the object is a living thing or non-living thing, as this will help me categorize the word significantly. Once I have that information, I can ask more specific questions about its characteristics.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is a living thing. | `thought`=Since the user confirmed that the hidden word is a living thing, I need to narrow down the possibilities further. I could ask whether it is an animal or a plant, as this would significantly reduce the search space. If the answer is 'yes' to being an animal, I can then ask more specific questions about its characteristics. If 'no', I can focus on plants. This approach will help me gather more information efficiently.
