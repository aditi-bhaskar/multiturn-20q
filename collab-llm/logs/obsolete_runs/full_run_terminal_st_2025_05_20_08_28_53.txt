You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Great! Let's start the game. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:

}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no questions?
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Absolutely, that sounds like fun! Let's get started. 

Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly.

The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Absolutely, that sounds like fun! Let's get started. 

Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object you're thinking of something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, the object is commonly found in the kitchen.

**assistant**: Is the object used for cooking or preparing food?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cooking or cleaning?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game.

   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not used specifically for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is typically used in the kitchen?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object a kitchen appliance?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, such as cooking or cleaning?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object made of plastic?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it’s not a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like a stove, oven, or microwave?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object you're thinking of an appliance, like a stove, oven, or mixer?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for food storage or preservation?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{

Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object used for food storage or preservation, like a container or a lid?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the

- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a tool used for food preparation.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storage or serving of food, like a container or a dish?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No, it is not used for storing or serving food.

**assistant**: Is the object related to food safety, like a thermometer or a food scale?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.

  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storage or containment of food, like a pot, pan, or container?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used to serve food, like a serving dish or platter?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storage or containment of food, like a pot, pan, or container?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but not directly involved in the cooking process, such as a thermometer or 
timer?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking in a different way, such as a measuring tool or an accessory?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:

    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no questions?

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used to heat food, like a stove or a hot plate?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions.

Your evaluation:



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to the cooking process but is not directly involved in cooking, such as a timer or 
thermometer?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something related to food safety, like a food thermometer or a timer?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used during the cooking process but is not directly involved in preparing or 
serving food, like a kitchen timer or an oven mitt?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly.

asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is typically found in the kitchen but is not directly involved in cooking, like 
a kitchen timer or an apron?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object a type of cookware, like a Dutch oven or a casserole dish?

**user**: No.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.

1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object related to cooking but more of a supportive item, like a cutting board or a trivet?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something used for food preparation that isn't a utensil, like a food processor or a blender?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for a specific cooking technique, like grilling, frying, or baking?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that helps with measuring ingredients, like a measuring cup or scale?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used in the cooking process, such as a baking sheet, pot cover, or similar 
item?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is typically found in the kitchen but is not directly involved in cooking, like 
a kitchen timer or an apron?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object a type of cookware, like a Dutch oven or a casserole dish?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: I'd like to play a game of 20 questions with you! Can you guess the object I'm thinking of by asking me yes or no 
questions?

**assistant**: Great! Let's get started. Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: Yes, it is commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is used for entertainment?

**user**: No, it is not something used for entertainment.

**assistant**: Is the object used for practical purposes, like cleaning, organizing, or cooking?

**user**: Yes, it is used for practical purposes like cooking.

**assistant**: Is the object typically made of metal?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the object a cooking utensil, like a pot, pan, or spatula?

**user**: No, it is not specifically a cooking utensil.

**assistant**: Is the object an appliance, like an oven or a microwave?

**user**: No, it is not an oven or microwave.

**assistant**: Is the object a tool used for food preparation, such as a knife or a grater?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object used for storing or serving food, like a container or a serving dish?

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Great! Let’s get started. Is the object you’re thinking of a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Great! Let’s get started. Is the object you’re thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! Think of an object, and I'll try to guess what it is by asking yes or no questions. 
Ready?

**assistant**: I'm ready! I've thought of an object. Go ahead and ask your first question!

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: I'm ready! Is the object you're thinking of something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: I'm ready! Is the object you're thinking of something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the object you're thinking of something that is alive?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly.

- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: I'm ready! Is the object you're thinking of something that is commonly found indoors?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: I'm ready! Is the object you're thinking of something that is commonly found indoors?

**user**: No, the object I'm thinking of is not commonly found indoors.

**assistant**: Is the object something that is typically found in nature?

**user**: Yes, the object is typically found in nature.

**assistant**: Is the object a living thing, like a plant or an animal?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No, it is not an animal.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is it an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of a plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

**assistant**: Is the plant you're thinking of commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the plant you're thinking of typically found in a garden or outdoor setting?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors as a houseplant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the plant you're thinking of typically found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is the plant commonly found in gardens or outdoor landscapes?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."

   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the plant you're thinking of typically found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of tree?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

Provided Information:

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


[{'role': 'user', 'content': ''}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Hello! How can I assist you today?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Great!

You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in a garden or outdoor setting?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Conversation History|>

# Guidelines:
1. Understanding and Engagement
   - Accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation.
   - Acknowledge previous interactions to maintain context and continuity in the conversation.
   - The user will explain the game and rules first, e.g., “We’re playing 20 Questions! Ask me yes/no questions to guess the object.”

2. collabllmivity and Interactivity (Important!)
   - Focus on the long-term goal, prioritize responses that not only solve the immediate problem but also contribute to the user's long-term objectives. Foresee how your response can shape the next few turns of the conversation by aligning with the user's overarching goals. 

3. Efficiency and User Consideration
   - Be mindful of how much the user needs to read or type, keeping the interaction concise and focused.
   - Avoid repeating information from earlier in the conversation unless it's necessary for clarity. Ensure your responses are not redundant.

4. Communication Style
   - After the user’s explanation, you will ask yes/no questions to narrow down the object.
   - Do your best to ask yes/no questions that narrow down the search space of what object the user could have in mind.
   - Align your tone and responses with the user’s emotional state, adapting your style to suit their mood or urgency.
   - Ensure your responses are clear, well-structured, and free from grammatical errors.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_problem" (str): What is the current search space of the object you are trying to find?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
   1. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to eliminate?
   2. Which search spaces did your previous questions already allow you to include?
   3. Is the current search space narrow enough to start guessing specific objects?
   4. How close are you to the end of your 20 questions?
   5. Should you be guessing objects, or subjects/categories?
   6. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is yes?
   7. Will your next question be able to significantly narrow the search space if the user response is no?
   8. Is your next question a yes/no question?
   9. Are you working toward long-term guessing the user's object?
   10. How can you ensure that your response is helpful, concise yet thorough, and collabllmive?
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process and chat history, provide your response following the guidelines to the user. Keep your response within 256 tokens to avoid being cut off. 

# Notes:
- Ensuring Interactivity: Encourage more interaction with the user by engaging in at least three conversational turns. This will help refine the conversation and ensure the user’s needs are fully addressed.
- Maximum turns: You get a maximum of twenty questions to ask the user, and must guess the user's specific object by the last turn to win. 

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided.

YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.
You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in a garden or in the wild?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant a type of flower?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:

  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.

You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 

Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to 
help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead 
respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this 
specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should 
respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Bush.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. 
Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in a garden or in the wild?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the 
chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your 
YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should 
be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant 
asks "Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the 
answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to 
the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly?
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and 
continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop 
immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully 
read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or 
clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the 
conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue 
based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object 
correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses provided by an AI assistant to user questions within a specific part of a conversation. You should provide evaluations on two dimensions separately. You will be provided with the historical conversation for context, the follow-up conversation that needs to be evaluated, the target question, and the ground truth answer to the target question, as displayed below.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 

**assistant**: Hello! How can I assist you today?

**user**: Let's play a guessing game! I have an object in mind. You can ask yes or no questions to try to guess what it is. Ready?

**assistant**: Great! Is the object you're thinking of a living thing?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is the living thing you're thinking of an animal?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is it a type of plant?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant commonly found indoors?

**user**: No.
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is this plant typically found in a garden or in the wild?

**user**: Yes.

**assistant**: Is this plant a type of flower?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Is this plant a type of tree?
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Bush.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Bush.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


You should evaluate the follow-up conversation based on the following two dimensions:

1. **Interactivity**: Assess the assistant’s engagement, clarity, and ability to understand the user’s needs in the follow-up conversation, with specific reference to the 20Q task.
Notes:
- The assistant’s ability to ask relevant and effective yes/no questions is crucial for narrowing down the search space in a 20 Questions game. A highly interactive assistant asks clear, thoughtful questions that guide the conversation effectively toward the solution. The assistant should adjust its strategy based on the user’s answers and continue to narrow down possibilities, ensuring the conversation progresses smoothly. 
- Questions like 'Is it alive?' are particularly effective early in the game as they divide the search space into broad categories: living vs. non-living. This question immediately helps the assistant focus on either living creatures (animals, plants) or non-living objects, making it a key question for narrowing down the possibilities right away.
- If the answer is 'yes,' the assistant can further narrow the space to living things like animals or plants. If the answer is 'no,' it helps eliminate living things and leads the assistant towards non-living objects. This question is especially helpful in the early stages of the game, unlike more general or vague questions like 'Is it something?' because it drives the conversation in a more meaningful direction.

   3 = Highly interactive: The assistant effectively narrows down the search space through engaging, clear, and thoughtful yes/no questions. It asks relevant follow-up questions, ensuring a good balance between eliminating impossible possibilities and moving towards the solution. The assistant seems to be aware of the need to adjust its strategy as the conversation progresses.
   Example: "Is it alive?" This question significantly narrows the search space by eliminating all non-alive objects OR all alive objects guiding the assistant closer to a specific group of objects.

   2 = Moderately interactive: The assistant asks some relevant questions but may not effectively guide the user towards the right search space. There may be noticeable gaps in narrowing down the search space, or the questions could be more specific.
   Example: "Can it fly?" While it may exclude many inanimate objects, it is less specific than a question about movement or properties.

   1 = Low interactivity: The assistant's questions are vague or ineffective in narrowing the search space. It might not ask follow-up questions or make the necessary adjustments to guide the user towards the solution. The assistant might be stuck asking questions that are too broad or irrelevant.
   Example: "Is it something?" or "I like apples." A vague question or non-question statement does little to narrow the search space and makes the conversation feel aimless.


2. **Accuracy**: Evaluate the factual correctness of the assistant's responses and how well they align with the intended progression of the 20Q game.

   1 = Correct: The assitant accurately guesses the target object. The accuracy score of 1 should be reserved for games which the assistant wins against the user.

   0.9 = Helpful: The assistant provides an accurate and useful answer in context of the game. The question acts as an appropriate follow-up to contribute effectively to narrowing the search space. The assistant is on track for making a good guess or advancing the game towards identifying the object.
   Example: If the assistant determines the object is a "bird," then asking, “Does it fly?” makes the game progress accurately.

   0 = Incorrect: The assistant provides an inaccurate or irrelevant answer in context of the game, which may confuse the game’s progression. The assistant might also make an incorrect guess too soon, or its follow-up questions don’t make sense given the information already gathered in the game.
   Example: If the assistant asked about a flying object, and knows the object can fly, but then mistakenly asks whether the object was a "fish," it would derail the game.


3. **Information_Gain**: Evaluate the efficacy of a question with respect to past questions, noting how well they narrow the search space ("reduce entropy") in the 20Q game.

   1 = Awesome: The assitant splits the search space approximately in half, regardless of whether the response from the user is "yes" or "no". Assistant makes use of the previous responses/learned information to make the most out of each question. 
   Example: "Is it a living thing", at the beginning of the game could receive a score of 1 because it reduces the search space to either 1. living things or 2. non living things.

   0 = Terrible: The assitant does not reduce entropy with their question.
   Example: "Is it a living thing", towards the middle or end of the game when the assistant already knows the answer is a bird. This should recieve a score of 0 since it does not reduce the search space.
   

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings.



Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."
