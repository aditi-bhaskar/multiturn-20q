[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to determine the category and characteristics of the hidden object the user has in mind. | `thought`=Since we haven't started asking questions yet, I need to begin by narrowing down the category of the object. Asking if it's a living thing or a non-living thing will help me establish a broad classification. This will set the foundation for my subsequent questions and help me focus on more specific attributes in later turns. I'm at the beginning of the game, so I have plenty of questions left to refine my guesses.
