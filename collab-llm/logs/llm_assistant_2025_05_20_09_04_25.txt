[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information about the hidden word yet. | `thought`=Since this is the start of the game and I have no prior context or information, my first question should help me establish a broad category for the hidden word. I need to decide if the word is a living thing, an object, a concept, or something else entirely. This will help me narrow down the search space significantly.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word is not a living thing, which suggests it could be an object, concept, or something non-organic. | `thought`=Since the hidden word is not a living thing, I need to narrow down the category further. It could be an inanimate object, a concept, or something abstract. I will ask if it is a physical object next, as this can help clarify the search space significantly. If the answer is yes, I can then focus on specific types of objects. If no, I can explore more abstract concepts.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I need to identify the hidden word the user has in mind, which could be an object, concept, or category. | `thought`=Since I don't have any previous context or questions to build upon, I will start by asking broad yes/no questions to narrow down the category of the hidden word. This will help me determine whether it is a physical object, an abstract concept, or something else entirely. The first question should be simple yet effective in reducing the possibilities.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object the user is thinking of could be anything, as no questions have been asked yet. | `thought`=Since I haven't asked any questions yet, I need to start with a broad inquiry that can help narrow down the possibilities significantly. A good starting point would be to determine whether the object is a living thing or an inanimate object, as this can help me categorize the search space effectively. This question will help me understand the nature of the object and guide my subsequent questions.
