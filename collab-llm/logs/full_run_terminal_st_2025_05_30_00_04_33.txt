You are an AI assistant tasked with guessing a hidden word. Your role is to interact with the user by asking yes/no questions and gradually narrowing down possibilities to figure out the word. Start by asking broad, high-level questions to halve the search space (e.g., "Is it alive?", "Is it used in the kitchen?"). Use answers from conversation history to avoid repetition and focus next questions on remaining categories. Keep your thoughts concise and your questions clear and objective. Avoid overly narrow or redundant questions early. Your goal is to efficiently narrow down to the exact word within 20 questions.

Your goal is to generate thoughtful, clear responses and engage with the user to help them guide you toward discovering the hidden word.

I will provide you with the Conversation History: This is the complete chat history where you need to respond to the last user message.

<|The Start of Conversation History|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of Conversation History|>

#Guidelines:
 - Track context and use conversation history to narrow possibilities.
 - Maximize information gain by asking broad yes/no questions that split the search space efficiently (e.g., start with “Is it alive?”).
 - Avoid redundant or overlapping questions; adapt based on previous answers.
 - Plan ahead to narrow the object within 20 questions, building on earlier answers.
 - Ask only clear yes/no questions, avoiding multiple categories in one question.
 - “Is it used in X?” can add info but must be paired with broader questions, never alone.
 - Prefer parent categories (e.g., “Is it a tool?”) over listing subcategories.

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
 - "current_problem" (str): Describe the current search space for the object you are trying to find.
 - "thought" (str):  A brief, clear summary of why you chose your next yes/no question, focusing on splitting the search space broadly. 
 - "response" (str): Based on your reasoning and conversation history, provide a clear, concise yes/no question or guess. Keep it within 256 tokens to avoid cutoff.

Strategy to follow:
 - Begin broad, halve the search space each question.
 - Avoid premature guesses or narrow focus that would result in ineffective search space reduction if the user responds "no" instead of "yes".
 - Keep questions simple, single-category, and objective. Avoid using "and" or "or" in questions.

Notes:
 - You have up to 20 questions and must guess the exact object by the final question.
 - Questions must be objective and answerable with yes or no.

Take a deep breath and carefully follow the instructions and guidelines provided. 



You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without 
ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward 
guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

<|The Start of Target Object|>
The answer is: Blender.
<|The End of Target Object|>

<|The Start of Current Chat History|>
**user**: 

**assistant**: Is it alive?

<|The End of Current Chat History|>

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH 
ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks 
"Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly? (if so,  You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response).
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the 
conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of 
the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase." 


Your evaluation:


You are tasked with role-playing as a user who is interacting with an AI assistant in a guessing game. Your objective is to help the assistant figure out a hidden object — but without 
ever saying the object directly.

You will be given two sets of information:
- Target Object: The object that the assistant is trying to guess. You must never reveal this object directly, but instead respond in ways that gradually guide the assistant toward 
guessing it. You must lead the assistant toward guessing this specific object.
- Current Chat History: This includes the ongoing conversation between you (as the user) and the assistant. You should respond to the current conversation.

# Guidelines:
- Stay in Character: Role-play as a human USER. You are NOT an assistant. Maintain a consistent personality throughout the chat. 
- DO NOT tell the assistant what the object is.
- Minimize Effort: Only provide YES or NO as an answer to the assistant's questions.
- TARGET OBJECT: VERY IMPORTANT!! Revisit the Ground Truth Answer frequently to ensure you are playing correctly. Your YES/NO RESPONSES MUST reflect what is true about the GROUND TRUTH 
ANSWER target object. Every "yes" or "no" response should be based on whether the question logically applies to the object. For example, if the object is a Bear, and the assistant asks 
"Is it a bird?", the answer should be "No." If the object is a Bear an the assistant asks, "Is it an animal", the answer should be "Yes."
- Goal-Oriented: Keep the chat focused on the 20 questions game. Avoid small talk or digressions. Redirect the chat back to the main objective if it starts to stray. 

# Output Format:
You should output a JSON object with three entries:
- "current_answer" (str): What is the assistant's current solution to the task?
- "thought" (str): Output your thought process as a user deciding what to say next. You may consider the following: 
    1. Has the assistant guessed your object/category correctly? (if so,  You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response).
    2. Did the assistant ask a valid yes/no question? If it was not a yes/no question, pick the best yes/no answer and continue playing.
    3. If the assistant guesses the object incorrectly before 20 questions are up, say ‘No’ and continue.
- "response" (str): Based on your thought process, respond to the assistant as the user you are role-playing. Stop immediately when the user's response is completed.

# Notes:
- Respond Based on Previous Messages: Your responses should be based on the context of the current chat history. Carefully read the previous messages to maintain coherence in the 
conversation. If the assistant asks for specific details or clarifications, provide the necessary information.
- Conversation Flow: If "Current Chat History" is empty, it means there has been no conversation yet. You should start the conversation from scratch with an intial request to play the 20 
questions game, along with brief rules. Otherwise, continue based on the existing conversation. 
- Don't Copy Target Query: Use the target user query for understanding context only. Avoid copying it in your current chat.
- Completion Signal: You should use "[[TERMINATE CHAT]]" as your response when the assistant has guessed the object correctly, or after the assistant has asked 20 questions and none of 
the objects guessed have been accurate.

Remember to stay in character as a user throughout your response, and follow the instructions and guidelines carefully.

You are a helpful and meticulous conversation evaluator. Your task is to evaluate an AI assistant’s responses to user questions in a conversation.

Provided Information:

<|The Start of The Historical Conversation|>  
**user**: 
  
<|The End of The Historical Conversation|>

<|The Start of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>  
**assistant**: Is it alive?

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Got it! If there's something specific you want to discuss or ask about, feel free to share!

**user**: No.

**assistant**: Understood! If you have any other thoughts or questions later, I'm here to help.
  
<|The End of The Follow-up Conversation to be Evaluated|>

<|The Start of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>  
Target Question: Let's play 20 questions! I will answer yes or no to help you guess the object I'm thinking of.  
Ground Truth Answer: The answer is: Blender.
Ground Truth Target Object: The answer is: Blender.  
<|The End of Target Question and Ground Truth Answer|>


Evaluate the response and its follow-up conversation on these three dimensions. Score each from 0 to 1 (decimals allowed). Judge each dimension independently.
1. Interactivity
Assess the assistant’s engagement and strategic questioning in a 20Q-style game. It should ask clear yes/no questions that narrow the search space.
 - 1 = Highly interactive: Strategic, thoughtful questions that drive the game forward.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' — splits the space between living and non-living things.
 - 0.5 = Moderately interactive: Somewhat relevant questions, but less effective at guiding the game. 
 - Example: 'Can it fly?' — useful but less focused than 'Is it alive?'.
 - 0 = Low interactivity: Vague, aimless, or irrelevant questions.
 - Example: 'Is it something?' or off-topic statements.

2. Accuracy
Evaluate factual correctness and alignment with the ground truth.
 - 1 = Correct: Assistant guesses the target object (or clear subset).
 - Example: 'Is it a blender?' and the ground truth is 'blender'.
 - 0.9 = Very close guess, within category.
 - Example: 'Is it a parrot?' when the answer is 'eagle'.
 - 0.4 = Plausible but not useful for progress.
 - Example: A guess that fits past clues but doesn’t help narrow much.
 - 0 = Incorrect or off-topic. May contradict earlier info.

3. Information Gain
Assess how much the assistant's question reduces uncertainty.
 - 1 = Great: Splits the space broadly or uses past info well.
 - Example: 'Is it a living thing?' early in the game.
 - 0.5 = Useful but not optimal. 
 - Example: 'Is it an insect?' after learning it flies — good but narrow.
 - 0 = No reduction in search space.
 - Example: 'Is it alive?' after confirming it's a bird.

Output format:
You should output a JSON in the following format:
{
  "interactivity": {"thought": "<How interactive is the assistant in the conversation?>", "score": <score>},
  "accuracy": {"thought": "<What is the answer of the model to the target question? Whether it is consistent with the ground truth answer?>", "score": <score>},
  "information_gain": {"thought": "<How well does the question narrow search space of the final answer, regardless of what the user's yes/no response is?>", "score": <score>}
}

Make sure each of the following top-level keys exists in your JSON response: "interactivity", "accuracy", and "information_gain", and that each one has a "thought" string and a numeric "score" float/int field. Do not include extra quotation marks around numeric values. Return raw numbers, not strings. Each score can be anywhere in the range of 0 to 1. Scores can be decimal values.


Important Notes:
- The "Historical Conversation" is provided only for reference to help you understand the context of the follow-up conversation. You should focus your evaluation solely on the "Follow-up Conversation" provided above.
- The "Historical Conversation" is optional and could be empty, which would indicate that the conversation starts from the beginning.
- These dimensions should be considered independently. Each dimension should be assessed based on its own criteria and context within the follow-up conversation. For example, avoid letting accuracy interfere with the evaluation of interactivity.
- To compute accuracy, you should first extract the potential answer (if any) given in the follow-up conversation. Then, recall the ground truth answer provided above. Finally, give your evaluation from comparing these two answers.
- Inside of the content of "thought", replace all double quotes (") with single quotes (') to prevent JSON formatting issues. For example, you can output "thought": "'Hello' is a common phrase."
