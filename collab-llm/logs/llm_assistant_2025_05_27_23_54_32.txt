[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=I have no information about the hidden word yet, so the search space is completely open. | `thought`=Since I have no previous context or information about the hidden word, I need to start broad to narrow down the possibilities. A good first question would be to determine whether the word refers to something that is alive or not, as this can significantly reduce the range of potential words.
