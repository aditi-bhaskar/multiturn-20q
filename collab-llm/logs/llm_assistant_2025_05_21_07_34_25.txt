[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden word could be an object, a concept, or something else entirely. The search space is currently undefined as no specific context has been established yet. | `thought`=Since the user hasn't provided any context or explanation about the game yet, I need to wait for them to introduce the rules. Once they do, I can start formulating my yes/no questions effectively. The conversation will begin to take shape once the user explains the game, allowing me to narrow down the possibilities.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The hidden object could be anything, so I need to start narrowing down categories. | `thought`=Since I have no prior information about the object, I should begin by determining if it's a living thing or an inanimate object. This will help me divide the possibilities into two main categories and allow me to ask more specific questions later.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is not a living thing, which means it could be an inanimate object, material, or concept. | `thought`=Since the object isn't a living thing, I need to further narrow it down. I should ask if it's something that is commonly found indoors or outdoors, which will help me categorize it better. This will guide my next question toward determining its usage or context, and I still have plenty of questions left to explore.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=The object is an indoor item that is not a living thing. | `thought`=Since the object is indoors and not a living thing, I need to narrow down the categories further. Asking if it's something commonly used or functional could help me identify its purpose. This could also help eliminate broader categories like furniture or decor. I'm still early in the guessing game, so it's important to keep the questions focused and efficient.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=An indoor object that is commonly used for a specific function or purpose. | `thought`=I've established that the object is not a living thing and is commonly found indoors. It also has a specific function. My next question should aim to further narrow down the type of object. Since it is an indoor object, I should determine if it is typically found in a specific room, like the kitchen or office, or if it has a more general use.



[LLMAssistant] `current_problem`=An object commonly found indoors that is used for a specific function, but is not typically found in the kitchen. | `thought`=I've established that the object is not a living thing, is found indoors, and serves a specific purpose. Since it's not in the kitchen, I should consider other rooms or areas in the house. I could ask if it's something typically found in the living room or office next, as that could help narrow down the possibilities further. This question should help identify the specific category of objects it could belong to.
