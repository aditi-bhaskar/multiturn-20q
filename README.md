For this project, I will implement an appropriate reward function for a multiturn RL LM. The reward will refer to 1. reducing entropy and 2. encouraging multi-part and followup questions.

This work is based on the multiturn reward system implemented in Collab LLM (Wu et al) and the 20q task dataset from LMRL Gym (Abdulhai et al).
